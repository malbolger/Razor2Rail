# Razor2Rail

- Go to the location you want to start your rail in game.
- Use the '>info' command and click your character.
- Write down the position information we will use that in just a bit. [Position: (1750, 3004, 58)] 
- We will only be using the first two numbers of this as X and Y. (X: 1750, Y: 3004)
- Note your direction in game starting @ 12 o'clock and going clockwise we have: (Up, North, Right, East, Down, South, Left, West)
- Mark a rune at this location for our Lumberjack to recall too.
- Record a [macro] of your movements in-game with razor.
- Download the latest release of Razor2Rail.
- Open Razor2Rail and input your X, Y, and Direction information into the slots given.
- Press open, select the macro you just recorded and press convert.
- There will be a rails.txt file in the base directory of the program.
- Copy the entire contents of this file into your rail script in razor.
